# PokeRandom-App
This is an android app that will display the image, name, and weight of 20 pokemon. The app is formatted using a recycleview so that as you scroll down, more pokemon appear. It follows a red, peach, orange theme and has 3 different fonts: aladin, architects_daughter, and atomic_age. Two styles were added into the themes.xml which are for the pokemon name and the weight of the pokemon. This app contains a RecyclerView that displays a list of scrollable data, and uses a downloable font with custom color and size.
